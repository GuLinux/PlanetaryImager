Supported Cameras
-----------------

ZWO ASI Cameras (my camera is an ASI178mm), v4l2 (including DMK and Celestron Skyris), QHY, FLIR/Point Grey via FlyCapture2 (all interfaces), IIDC (including all FLIR/Point Grey FireWire and USB models).


Requirements
------------
 * Qt version >= 5.5
 * A recent boost library version (tested with 1.55 and above).
 * c++14 compliant compiler (tested with gcc >= 5 and clang)
 * OpenCV
 * boost (libboost-all-dev)
 * fxload (to load firmware on QHY cameras)
 * ccfits
 * libdc1394 (for IIDC driver)
 * FlyCapture2 SDK (for FLIR/Point Grey cameras)

 
Source download
---------------

You need to use the following commands to clone both planetary imager and its submodules.
A simple git clone won't work!

Master (development) version:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/GuLinux/PlanetaryImager.git 

Stable release (replace 'v0.6.2' with the current stable release, if needed):

    git clone --recursive -b v0.6.2 https://github.com/GuLinux/PlanetaryImager.git 
    

Compile Howto
-------------

These are generic instructions, and assume you're already familiar with building a package from sources.
If not, please try binary releases first.

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
    make all && sudo make install

To enable a driver not enabled by default, either add `DEFAULT_ON` as argument to `add_driver()` in driver's `CMakeLists.txt file`, or set `BUILD_DRIVER_xxx:BOOL=ON` in CMakeCache.txt in the build directory.

To run without installing, you must specify the drivers location as a parameter. E.g. when in build directory, use:


    src/planetary_imager --drivers .


Uninstall
---------

If you installed PlanetaryImager from a precompiled package, just use your package manager to remove it.

If you installed PlanetaryImager from sources, just go to the source directory where you compiled it, and run the folowing:
```cat install_manifest.txt  | while read file; do [[ -r $file ]] && ! [[ -d $file ]] && sudo rm -f $file; done```

When compiling from sources, it is often advised to uninstall the previous version before installing the new one.


Windows version
---------------

Currently, windows snapshots are compiled using [MXE](http://mxe.cc/).
It has not been really tested a lot, but to help investigating problems, please try another Windows application first, to see if your camera driver is properly working.


OSX Version
-----------

I have been unable to create a binary package for OSX, since I don't really have a development environment on OSX, but I could do a few tests, and I managed to compile it by using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

To get a working version, please follow these instructions:

 * Install homebrew, following instructions on their website
 * Run the following command to install dependencies:
 
    ```brew install git cmake qt5 cfitsio ccfits opencv3 boost```
 * clone the repository (follow the instruction in the "Source download" section)
 * compile (follow instructions in "Compile Howto")
   * When running cmake, be sure to add the following directive (change Qt version if needed)
   
     ```-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/qt5/5.8.0_1```
 * run `planetary_imager` from your command line

 
IIDC (libdc1394)
----------------

If you camera is not detected, you may need to use a newer version of `libdc1394`. In case of building the library on your own, the supported USB device ids are hard-coded in `usb/control.c` in `usb_products[]`. You can check your camera's VID/PID by calling `lsusb`, e.g. (for the Firefly MV camera):

    ...
    Bus 002 Device 003: ID 1e10:2001 Point Grey Research, Inc.
    ...
    
    
FlyCapture2 (FLIR/Point Grey)
-----------------------------

Installation of FlyCapture2 SDK is required (available from the FLIR website). On Windows, make sure to add the binaries directory to `PATH` (by default, `C:\Program Files\Point Grey Research\FlyCapture2\bin64` or `C:\Program Files (x86)\Point Grey Research\FlyCapture2\bin`). On Linux, if your distribution does not use `.deb` package format (which is used by the SDK), simply unpack the packages manually. In any case, run the install script to create `udev` device rules.

When building from sources, make sure that the `FC2_INCLUDE_DIR` variable in `src/drivers/flycapture2/CMakeLists.txt` is set correctly.
